                    <p>Having eaten at various Loch Fyne restaurants around the south, we couldn't resist the chance of eating at the original Oyster Bar while we were staying in the Trussochs.

We were not disappointed. My starter of mussels with chorizo and spinach was wonderful - the chorizo providing a spicy balance to the sweet mussels. My other half had the classic smoked salmon, which was (as you would hope) just right - not over-smoked but with lots of flavour. I also had a oyster (natural), which was a good size with a delicate flavour.

For my main course I had a whole baked seabream, stuffed with lemon and thyme. Perhaps just a tad over-cooked, the lemon and herbs really brought out the flavour of the fish. Our other main of seabass with lemon butter had a bit too much butter, but the fish was cooked perfectly and was spanking fresh.

The accompanying vegetables were pretty unimaginative - steamed carrots, brocolli, cauli and mange tout with butter - but at least they were not overcooked.
